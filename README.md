Overview
This mod has its start date in 1550 and shows how different European politics could have been if small things had gone differently in early medieval history.

General changes

The governing capacity system will be tweaked to account for governing efficiency modifiers, province autonomy etc.
Zoroastrian will become more viable, with permanent CBs on everyone (whether of the same faith or not, and a similar mechanic to Coptic holy sites), they will also be allowed to make tributaries.

(Potentially) Changes to various modifiers that would take into account distance from the capital. I.e. missionary strength, culture conversion cost & time, settler chance, governing capacity, core-creation cost.
This modifier would decrease in importance as administrative technology increases.

A new Russian tag, formed by decision by Novgorod. New ideas and a unique government.
We can’t make a separate tag bc it would destroy all Russian events and potentially lead to 2 Russias. We can change it so that the government doesn’t automatically change form.
Or rather a different decision available to Russian culture republics that gives them a different idea event, and a different government form.

A triggered modifier for peasant republics rgiving -2 diplo rep but -2 national unrest.

A similar event chain to the Burgundian Inheritance, but for Scotland, so that it can choose between England, France and potentially an outside power like Scandinavia.
